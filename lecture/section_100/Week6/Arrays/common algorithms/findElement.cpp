/*
Arrays - Algorithm 3
This program is used to illustrate how you can find an element in a given array

Things to ask yourself
- Okay, my program needs to search for an element in an array, do I have everything I need?
- Maybe I need that array, and that one element to search for!

How to approach this problem
- By now, I know that array has stored it's elements in a sequential order
- So let me look through the array one at a time and find it.
- It's definitely not there when I have looked into it completely and still not found it

#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int main() {

    // 1. The array to search for
    int array[10] = {3, 6, 1, 0, -9, 2, 16, 8, 11, -2}; // Declared and Initialized!

    // 2. The element to find
    int element = -9;

    // 3. Let's check if the array has the element within it

    return 0;
