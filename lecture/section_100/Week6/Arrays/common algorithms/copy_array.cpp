/*
Arrays - Algorithm 2
This program is used to illustrate how you copy one array into another
Let's assume you want to copy one array into another, and that it's an integer array.

Things to ask yourself
- Do I have the original array to make a copy of
- Should I make an entire copy of it

How to approach this problem
- Fine, we have an array, let's just loop over it one by one
- When we do so, let's take each element at a time and put it into the copy of array
*/

#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int main() {

    // 1. An array to make a copy of (this could be any datatype)
    

    // 2. Declare another array and call it array_copy

    // 3. Well I guess, I can't copy variables like I did before
    // int y = x; -> This is only fine with primitive types like ints, floats, doubles, chars, bools and strings

    // So let's loop over each element and take them one by one
    

    // Let's print the copy of array to see if the copy was successful

    return 0;
}
