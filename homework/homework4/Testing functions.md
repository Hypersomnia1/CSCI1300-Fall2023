# Testing functions <a name="tests"></a>

Every C++ program you write should include a main function that tests the function you wrote.
There will be 3 different types of test cases you are expected to write depending on the return type of the function.
Listed below is how we expect you to test different types of functions. The process will be different
if you are testing a `void` function, a non-void function that return an `int` or `bool`, or a non-void function
that returns a `double`.

#### 1. Void Functions with printed output <a name="void"></a>

For **void** functions that have printed output (i.e. functions that use `cout` to print to the terminal), call the testing function in the main function. Your tests should include the expected output in comments.

See the sample code below:
```c++
void checkDiscount(double discount) 
{
    if (discount >= 50) 
    {
        cout << "Great discount!" << endl;
    } 
    else 
    {
        cout << "Not a great discount." << endl;
    }
    return;
}
int main() 
{
    // test 1 for checkDiscount
    // expected output: "Great discount!"
    checkDiscount(82.7);

    // test 2 for checkDiscount
    // expected output: "Not a great discount."
    checkDiscount(22);

    return 0;
}
```
_* For the purpose of this test code snippet, algorithm comments were not included, but they are still expected in your C++ files._

#### 2. Non-Void Functions returning bool or int <a name="non-void-bool-int"></a>

For functions that return a **bool, char or int**, use **assert statements** 
from the **cassert** library (`#include <cassert>`) with a conditional expression.

Assert statements contain a conditional expression which will evaluate to `true` if the function's actual output matches what's expected. If the conditional expression evaluates to `false`, then your program will stop running after printing an error message.

For the purpose of this project, functions that return a `bool`, `char` or `int` can be compared to a specific value using the equality operator `==`.

Your test will look something like this:

`assert(<function call> == <value to compare to>);`

* `<function call>` is where you will call the function you want to test with its function parameters.
* `<value to compare to>` is the value you expect the function to return.
* `==` is the equality operator, and it compares the equality of both sides of itself.

See the sample code below:
```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <cassert>
using namespace std;

int addInts(int num1, int num2)
{
    // add num1 and num2 before returning
    return num1 + num2;
}

// isDrivingAge() returns true if the given age passed as a parameter
// is greater than or equal to 16, otherwise it returns false.
bool isDrivingAge(int age)
{
    return age >= 16;
}

int main()
{
    // test 1 for addInts
    assert(addInts(5, 6) == 11);

    // test 2 for addInts
    assert(addInts(10, 10) == 20);

    // test 3 for drivingAge
    assert(isDrivingAge(17) == true);

    // test 4 for drivingAge
    assert(isDrivingAge(14) == false);
}
```

#### 3. Non-Void Functions returning double <a name="non-void-double"></a>

For functions that return a **double**, you should use an **assert statement** from the **cassert** header (`#include <cassert>`) with a conditional expression like above. The difference is that you will also need to include the following function in your program:
```c++
/**
 * doublesEqual will test if two doubles are equal to each other within two decimal places.
 */
bool doublesEqual(double a, double b, const double epsilon = 1e-2)
{
    double c = a - b;
    return c < epsilon && -c < epsilon;
}
```
Because the `double` type holds so much precision, it will be hard to compare the equality of a function that returns a 
double with another double value. To overcome this challenge, we can compare `double` values within a certain range 
of precision or decimal places. The function above compares the equality of two variables `a` and `b` up to two decimal places, and returns `true` if the values of `a` and `b` are equal with each other up to two decimal places.

You will be expected to use this function in conjunction with `assert` statements to test functions that return 
the type double.

Your test will look something like this: 

`assert(doublesEqual(<function call>, <value to compare to>));`

 * `<function call>` is where you will call the function you want to test with its function parameters 
 * `<value to compare to>` is the `double` value you expect the function to return.


See the sample code below:
```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <cassert>
using namespace std;
/**
 * doublesEqual will test if two doubles are equal to each other within two decimal places.
 */
bool doublesEqual(double a, double b, const double epsilon = 1e-2)
{
    double c = a - b;
    return c < epsilon && -c < epsilon;
}
/**
 * reciprocal returns the value of 1 divided by the number passed into the function.
 */
double reciprocal(int num)
{
    return 1.0 / num;
}
int main()
{
    // test 1 for reciprocal
    assert(doublesEqual(reciprocal(6), 0.16));
    // test 2 for reciprocal
    assert(doublesEqual(reciprocal(12), 0.083));
}
```
For test 1, `reciprocal(6)` is being called, and we expect the function to return the value `0.16`.
The return value of `reciprocal(6)` and `0.16` is passed in as parameters to the `doublesEquals` function,
which will then return `true` if these two values are equal or `false` if they are not.

_* For the purpose of this test code snippet, algorithm comments were not included, but they are still expected in your C++ files._

#### 4. Functions manipulating arrays <a name="test-function-array"></a>

Functions which manipulate arrays passed as arguments can be tested by asserting on individual elements of the array after calling the function. This works even for `void` functions because arrays are passed by reference; even if the function doesn't return anything, the array in the function is the same array in memory as the one outside the scope of your function.

Note that if the array is an array of `double`, the `doublesEqual` function described [here](#non-void-double) should be used to assert on individual array elements.

See the sample code below:
```cpp
#include<iostream>
#include<cassert>
using namespace std;

/**
 * Add one to each element of the array.
 */
void addOneToArrayElements(int arr[], int size) 
{
    for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) 
    {
        arr[i] = arr[i] + 1;
    }
}

int main() {
    // test 1 for addOneToArrayElements
    int test1_arr[3] = {1, 2, 3};
    addOneToArrayElements(test1Arr, 3);
    assert(test1_arr[0] == 2);
    assert(test1_arr[1] == 3);
    assert(test1_arr[2] == 4);

    // test 2 for addOneToArrayElements
    int test2_arr[3] = {8, 10};
    addOneToArrayElements(test2Arr, 2);
    assert(test2_arr[0] == 9);
    assert(test2_arr[1] == 11);
}
```
